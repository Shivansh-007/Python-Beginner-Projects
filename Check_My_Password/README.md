### Import Requests
Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic. Here is an awesome resource to learn more about [Requests Python Library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

### Hashlib
This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2) as well as RSA’s MD5 algorithm (defined in Internet RFC 1321). The terms “secure hash” and “message digest” are interchangeable. Older algorithms were called message digests. The modern term is secure hash.

### Sys
This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available. Here is an awesome resource to learn more about [Sys Python Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
